Dear Candidate,

 

It is almost time for your Technical Test!

 

Firstly, please, ensure you have everything ready. Following you can find a reminder of what you need:

You will need to have npm so you can create a React project with TypeScript (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/#installation)
You will need an editor like Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Internet access is required for the test
 

Now, following you will find the instructions for the Test. Please, read carefully:

 

Goal of the test is to build a React application (in Typescript) that shows a list of Pokemons and the details.
You can find the prototype of the app in this link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/282d465a-abe9-46e3-4b98-338b7ca3b005-5e1c/
You can find the API in this link: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html
In the All Pokemon list view, showing 20 is enough. Optional: adding pagination or loading more on scroll.
History will show the list of the latest 5 visited Pokemons, please, store the history in the browser. Optional: If many tabs of the application are opened the history should be synced.
Detail view will show only 3 elements from the Pokemon and show it in the columns as shown in the prototype.
Once you have completed the Test, you can use a public repository like Github to upload the code, or you can just send the code in a compressed file.

 

We will connect with you after the Test has been reviewed by our panel of experts.
